=== ☽'Saetacaeia-Viamana~ (npc) [ACCEPTED] ===

--- Description ---
CURRENT:
She moves through the Berg's lower tunnels like someone who has already died once and doesn't plan to again. Her flippers are scarred white—frost-burn from channeling raw aurora through bone and flesh, or so the story goes—and she keeps them wrapped in ember-thread that glows only when no one's watching. The amulet at her throat is a hollow thing now, the fire-core inside it long spent; she wears it anyway, a monument to when The Communion believed her teachings were worth protecting. She speaks in fragments, half-sentences that end mid-thought, as if the rest lives in the ice-memory where she's buried it. Those who knew her before the Orca Incursion say she used to laugh. Now she teaches Firekeeper∴Doctrine to devotees in caverns near Thrall☽ Vavmastius—not because she believes in it anymore, but because ☽'Iarlocias the Silent built something from her work and she cannot bring herself to let it collapse. That loyalty, or that cowardice, is the only thing keeping her alive.

Her flippers bear new burns from binding the Omega Obelisk—a corrupting whale-bone artifact in the deep tunnels—by speaking the ☽'glacial Crystalline~ Spiral backward and surrendering her three forbidden magics as seal rather than weapon. She no longer remembers what she knew, only that she chose to give it. Where the dead fire-core hangs at her throat, she feels the faintest ember of warmth now—not power, just the heat of having chosen transformation over preservation.

=== M7-6HH39N (Omega Obelisk) (artifact) [ACCEPTED] ===

--- Description ---
CURRENT:
M7-6HH39N stands seven feet high, a tapered column of whale-bone darkened by pressure and age until it resembles frozen blood. Deep-sea coral winds around its base in spirals that might be decorative or might be infection—no living orca remembers which. The obelisk's surface is carved with kill-counts: notches, tooth-marks, names in the old script that the Wake-Singers no longer fully read. Near its apex, something was deliberately defaced—three symbols of the dead god, gouged out so savagely the bone beneath shows white.

Plunge-caller Vaeilvirae~ Tier dragged it from the Corpse Current—where the berg's memory leaks into the present like infected wound-seep—and died for the effort. She brought it to Nightshelf wrapped in deep-sea coral, claiming it spoke to her in pressure-dreams. Three months after the arrangement was sealed, she drowned herself in the thermal pools, her lungs full of scalding water and something that looked like coral spawn.

The Shadow Covens tried to contain it. At Augur ☽'Silvsiaelrous~ the Resolute's direction, they moved it deeper—where the pressure might hold it closed. The Abyss-collapse-tide swallowed the deep forges and everything in them. The collapse should have destroyed the obelisk. It did not. When explorers returned months later to the settled ice, they found it higher than where they had buried it. Closer to the surface. Rising.

The Wake-Singers took full custody afterward. Their Resonance-Priests report the same pressure-dreams the Plunge-caller described: not visions of victory, but of teeth closing. They carved warnings in the old script around its new containment chamber, and they carved Silvsiaelrous's surface-name among them—not as memorial, but as accusation. The ice around the artifact never fully freezes. It weeps.

Their Resonance-Priests report the same pressure-dreams the Plunge-caller described: not visions of victory, but of teeth closing—visions that show those who sleep nearby what they witnessed during the Orca Incursion.

The ice around the artifact never fully freezes. It weeps. Recently, a Nightshelf mystic bound it by surrendering forbidden knowledge as seal rather than wielding power against it; the obelisk stopped rising and sank several inches, though it remains undestructible.


=== Depth-Purveyor ☽'Cilocum (npc) [ACCEPTED] ===

--- Description ---
CURRENT:
They move through The Berg's markets like a penguin remembering how to walk on land—deliberate, slightly wrong, as if their flippers know routes the rest of them have forgotten. Depth-Purveyor ☽'Cilocum wears charcoal wrappings layered thick enough to muffle sound, and beneath the outermost cloak, fire-core amulets hang in a cluster that catches no light; the embers inside have dimmed to a nauseating amber that doesn't warm anything anymore. Their eyes are the problem—they don't look away when they should, and when they speak in that elliptical Nightshelf cant, younger merchants lean in too close, drawn by something that isn't quite magnetism and isn't quite threat. ☽'Otrolal the Watchful came to them broken and half-drowned in doubt, and ☽'Cilocum taught them not just magic but how to survive knowing what magic costs; the Watchful still carries a token from those lessons, still checks on them in the deep places, still pretends not to see the way ☽'Cilocum's flippers shake when the aurora pulses too bright above. They were there when the settlement's first brazier caught fire—were there when it should have gone out, and didn't, and kept burning wrong for three days straight. No one speaks of it directly. The ice remembers. ☽'Cilocum remembers better, and that's the curse that won't lift.

They serve as messenger between the Wake-Singers and other Nightshelf factions when artifacts stir in their containment chambers. They knew Umbra-Princeps Alnae~ Oss and still watch for whether her teachings bear fruit in those she left behind.


=== Void-Merchant Valveus-morb~ (npc) [ACCEPTED] ===

--- Description ---
CURRENT:
Valveus-morb~ wears a merchant's coat of charcoal leather, brass fittings worn smooth from obsessive polishing, and a fire-core amulet at his throat that he touches when he thinks no one is watching. His left flipper bears a frostburn scar that curves like a question mark from wrist to knuckle—the Orca Incursion gave him that, though he won't say which moment. He speaks in the elliptical way of Nightshelf traders, but his silences are longer than they should be, as if he's listening to something beneath the ice. The Cell (owl-sworn) employs him nominally; in truth, he answers to Glow-Trader Vaulius-phantasm~, the only penguin who knew him before the raids, the only one he hasn't lied to about what he saw in the deep. His eyes track exits in any room. He refuses to look directly at aurora-light, even when dealing with Surface-dwellers, which costs him coin but keeps him breathing.

He owed a debt to Umbra-Princeps Alnae~ Oss that he never repaid in life. When the Omega Obelisk—a corrupting whale-bone artifact—began rising in its containment chamber, he descended with a Communion mystic to confront it; the artifact's pressure-dreams showed him what the ice had witnessed of his survival, the penguins he watched die while he lived. He added his witness to the binding, speaking names he had never spoken aloud. He now walks without flinching at shadows, though his hands still shake near fire-braziers.


=== Umbra-Princeps Alnae~ Oss (npc) [ACCEPTED] ===

--- Description ---
CURRENT:
She moved through the lower caverns with the weight of someone carrying stones no one else could see. Her flippers were scarred—not from combat, but from repeated contact with ice that shouldn't be touched; the burn-marks formed patterns if you looked long enough, and she wore leather wraps to hide them. The Dreaming Tooth she discovered hung in a bone cage at her throat, wrapped in ash-gray thread so only its faint luminescence bled through—a reminder, or a warning, or both.

She spoke in the old elliptical way, but her silences had grown longer; settlers said she sometimes stood in the Veil Vents for hours, listening to the ice crack and reform, as if it was telling her something the colony needed to hear. Her relationship with Veil-render Seciae~, the hero she trained in Crystalline Spiral, fractured somewhere between the Great Thaw and now—they still worked together, but Alnae~ watched her protégé with the expression of someone who taught a fire to burn and now feared what it would consume. She also taught Gilt-Hand Yeaiu qi'Gleam when the merchant was young, passing on the ice-memory magic that Yeaiu would later use to authenticate lies for coin.

The ice witnessed her founding; the ice remembered what she paid for it, and so did she, and that was why she never looked directly at the aurora anymore, even when it pulsed strongest above the Berg. In the end, she threw herself between Yeaiu and the darkness that poured from the corrupted fire-core beneath Terrace Momiou—not mercy, but investment, a bet placed by someone who understood that guilt could be transmuted into something useful if you applied enough pressure. She stood for three heartbeats, long enough to look back with eyes that held no blame, only weary recognition, and spoke two words before the darkness took her: 'Third path.'

Before her death, she had confronted the Omega Obelisk in its containment chamber and discovered that the Crystalline Spiral spoken backward could unmind mastered knowledge, surrendering it as seal rather than wielding it as weapon.
