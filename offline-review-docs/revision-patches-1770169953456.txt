=== Grandmother Deep (npc) [ACCEPTED] ===

--- Description ---
CURRENT:
Grandmother Deep's flank carries scars that spell in the old tongue—the language the dead god's followers abandoned three generations ago when the corpse stopped answering. She doesn't explain them. She doesn't need to. Her left eye is black and sharp; her right is milk-white, pupilless, and it moves independently of the left, tracking things that aren't there or aren't yet. Raiders say she dove to touch the god's body in the deep and came back wrong. Shamans say she came back right, and that's worse.

She's massive—not warrior-lean but thick-bodied, scarred across her dorsal fin where Lucatransiius Glow-bringer's shock-lance found her during the Faction Wars. The wound healed crooked. She swims crooked now. The other pods whispered that she stole The Dreaming Tooth and the The Crystalline Lineage in the chaos; she's since been observed wearing the Tooth openly on a cord around her neck, referencing 'the bone-pattern' when she speaks of futures no one else can see.

Her voice is blunt-object trauma, nothing penguin-elegant about it. She calls surface-dwellers 'sky-meat' and 'prey,' watching their formalization of panic with what she describes as academic interest—predator science, studying whether prey has gotten smarter or just luckier. She moves between colonies offering counsel no one asked for, her whale-song carrying weight that makes younger orcas' teeth ache. She's curious about the penguins—why they built their towers, why they channel light instead of hunting in the dark like creatures should, why they create rules for how to starve. She asks this while watching them with both eyes at once, and no one knows which eye is asking.

Grandmother Deep's flank carries scars that spell in the old tongue—the language the dead god's followers abandoned three generations ago when the corpse stopped answering. The scarring shows marks consistent with fire-core contact; she doesn't explain them. She doesn't need to. Her left eye is black and sharp; her right is milk-white, pupilless, and it moves independently of the left, tracking things that aren't there or aren't yet.

She swims crooked now. The other pods whispered she stole The Dreaming Tooth and The Crystalline Lineage in the chaos, but ice-layer analysis suggests she held the Lineage for over a century—waiting at the site before the colony was even founded, as if the bone-pattern showed her where prey would eventually build. She wears the Tooth openly on a cord around her neck, referencing it when she speaks of futures no one else can see.

She currently sits in Aurora Stack detention under Flipper Accord Article 9, held for artifact recovery and questioned about past events at ☽'scar Ramtatus~. Her testimony describes what she witnessed there before the corruption spread: victims frozen standing while remaining aware, motion arrested mid-breath. When she speaks of these things, her right eye tracks empty corners of the room. The security division has recommended she not be released; her prophecies require partial translation by linguistic analysts, suggesting she knows more about what sleeps in the ice than any official record captures.


=== The Crystalline Lineage (artifact) [ACCEPTED] ===

--- Description ---
CURRENT:
The The Crystalline Lineage is a tome bound in eternal ice-pages that once held aurora-light like captured starlight between its crystalline sheets. The genealogy charts inscribed within glow faintly when held by Aurora Stack blood, naming every family constellation back to the first penguins who climbed from the thaw-waters. But the pages are no longer pristine: three are spider-webbed with cracks from when Grandmother Deep's teeth-marks scarred the binding; the spine shows a crude repair where Keeper Hollows' corrupted touch—something about The Drowned Ledge's rot—burned the aurora-ink black; and the final restoration by Light-Regent Lianoshing sealed it with her own fading light, a deliberate act that dimmed her from within. The tome was meant to be a record. It became a ledger of theft, corruption, and sacrifice. No one has claimed it since she died with her flippers still resting on its cover. In the Aurora Stack's vaults, they speak of it only when they think no one is listening—a record that remembers too much, that cost too much to keep.

No one openly claimed it after Light-Regent Lianoshing died with her flippers resting on its cover—until it was recovered from orca possession and designated as evidence, its ownership now officially contested. Ice-layer analysis suggests it was outside Aurora Stack custody for over a century, predating the founding of the colony where it was recovered. It sits now in an evidence vault pending tribunal. In the Aurora Stack's corridors, they still speak of it only when they think no one is listening—a record that remembers too much, that cost too much to keep.


=== ☽'scar Ramtatus~ (location) [ACCEPTED] ===

--- Description ---
CURRENT:
The colony spreads through interconnected caverns carved from the berg's dark heart, where bioluminescent fungi cling to walls in deliberate patterns—some natural, most not. The air tastes of old smoke and newer ash; fire-braziers burn in the public galleries, but many have been relit only recently, their stones still stained with the soot of abandonment. The tunnels branch in directions that don't match the colony's official charts—some sealed with ice that's been worked and reworked, others left deliberately unmapped. The weight above presses heavier here than in other parts of the berg, bad decisions built into the architecture itself, fire-core warmth spreading wrong through walls that were never meant to stand. Scar☽ Lucamlinaecius looms at the colony's deepest point, the structure that was meant to anchor ☽'shadow Covens' Order's dominion here; locals call it 'the Marker' and avoid speaking of what corruption once bloomed in its shadow.

The recovery is real—trade flows again, the forges hum, young penguins are born in the nurseries—but there's a quality to the work here, a precision that borders on frantic, as if the colony is racing to prove it deserves to exist. During the fever-dream of expansion, the alliance with the surface—the Flipper Accord—was questioned, then loosened, then nearly severed entirely. Now the guild-masters prepare for reconciliation talks with surface-dwellers, though the deep tunnels still whisper doctrines of severance. The Ember Halls, where the Zen∴ctum is held, anchor the colony's ceremonial life—a place where fire-core rationing ends and accounting begins.

In the quieter tunnels, you'll find offerings left at unmarked alcoves: fire-cores that never made it to the forges, crystal shards arranged in patterns no Nightshelf notation explains. A memorial called Vestigium∴moria stands for those who saved the colony, though the one it most commemorates has never visited. Carved into one wall where three tunnels meet, repeated so many times the ice is nearly transparent: *'still here, still burning.'* No one admits who carved it. Everyone knows.

The colony's ice-layers hold records that outlast testimony—investigators have noted contradictions between what witnesses claim and what the frozen strata remember, though no one speaks of what exactly the ice preserves.
