    "userPrompt": "# Task\nWrite a 250-400 word Folk Song.\n\nRequirements:\n- Follow the document structure and voice guidance below\n- Assign the provided characters to the document roles defined below\n- Incorporate the listed events naturally as context or content\n- Follow the Entity Writing Directives for each character's speech and behavior\n- Ground the document in the historical era and timeline provided\n- Make the document feel authentic - as if it exists within the world\n- Write the document directly with no meta-commentary\n\n# Document Instructions\nThis is a folk song meant to be sung. Rhythm and rhyme are paramount. Story is optional - if present, it's told obliquely through images and refrains rather than narrated directly. The song should feel like it's been passed through many voices, smoothed by repetition into something that sounds inevitable.\n\nSTRUCTURE:\n- Collector's Note (~40 words): Brief context. Where this song is sung, by whom, on what occasions. Attribution if known (\"commonly heard among the river traders\" or \"attributed to the blind poet Kael\").\n- Verse 1 (~60 words, 4-6 lines): Establish the song's world in images, not exposition. A place, a mood, a season, a figure. The rhythm and rhyme scheme are set here - ABAB, AABB, or ABCB. The reader should hear the melody even without music.\n- Refrain (~30 words, 2-4 lines): The emotional heart. Repeated after each verse. Should be the most singable, most memorable lines. May be a question, a lament, a boast, or a cryptic phrase that gains meaning through repetition.\n- Verse 2 (~60 words, 4-6 lines): Develop or shift. New images that rhyme (thematically, not just phonetically) with verse 1. If there's a story, it advances here - but through image, not plot. The same rhyme scheme.\n- Refrain (repeat)\n- Verse 3 (~60 words, 4-6 lines): The turn or deepening. What seemed simple now carries weight. If a story, its consequence. If mood, its darkest or brightest point. The same structure, different content.\n- Refrain (repeat, possibly with one word changed for devastating effect)\n- Final Verse or Coda (~40 words, 2-4 lines, optional): Brief. May circle back to verse 1's opening image. May break the pattern. Ends the song with resonance.\n\nVOICE & TONE: The voice of many mouths. This song belongs to a community, not an author. The language is simple but precise - no word wasted. Singable, rhythmic, communal, haunting, worn-smooth.\n\nRhyme and rhythm are more important than narrative clarity. Near-rhymes and slant-rhymes are welcome. Meter should be consistent within verses (tetrameter or trimeter work well for folk songs). The song should sound good read aloud.\n\nInclude imagery specific to the world and culture. Use concrete nouns over abstractions. The song's meaning may be debated - \"some say this is about the fall of the Silver Court, others claim it's a love song.\"\n\nAvoid prose disguised as verse, forced rhymes that sacrifice meaning, modern idioms, complex vocabulary. Folk songs use common words arranged uncommonly.\n\n# How to Use Events\nEvents become imagery. A war becomes \"the red year.\" A leader becomes \"the one who wore the crown of thorns.\" The song remembers events as feelings and images, not facts.\n\n# Narrative Voice\nSynthesized prose guidance for this chronicle:\n\n**RHYTHM_AND_COMPRESSION**: Verses flow in strict meter with hard rhymes—this is working song, maintenance chant, something sung to stay awake during fire-core shifts. Semicolons and line breaks do narrative work; enjambment carries momentum between stanzas.\n**IMAGERY_AS_STORY**: Don't narrate—accumulate images. Let frost in lungs, claws scratching stone, pages burning in darkness build meaning through repetition and variation. The refrain returns with new weight each time.\n**NIGHTSHELF_ELLIPSIS**: Speak in the Nightshelf mode: coded warnings, proverbs that sound simple but conceal edges, half-spoken truths. What's left unsaid matters more than what's sung. Names appear without explanation; listeners either know or learn why silence follows.\n**UNDERGROUND_PHYSICALITY**: Every image roots in tunnel-sensory: the smell of fire-core, echo-patterns, weight of stone above. Heat is specific—volcanic, costly, shared. Darkness isn't absence but texture, presence, safety.\n**REFRAIN_AS_WARNING**: The returning chorus isn't comfort—it's reminder, caution, the thing that won't let you forget. Each repetition should accumulate new meaning as verses add context, like a proverb that means more the third time you hear it.\n\n# Entity Writing Directives\nSpecific guidance for writing each entity — interpret creatively, don't reproduce this language directly:\n\n**Drift-coalesce (glacial)**: In verse, this becomes frost-in-wrong-places imagery: ice growing in lungs, marrow crystallizing, breath that cuts from inside. The aurora-stack formality twists into corruption language—'sky-gift turned curse,' 'light that freezes the living.' Show the price physically: frostbite scars, frozen breath, the blue tint under skin that never warms.\n**The Midnight Claws**: Name them in verse but never explain—Nightshelf style respects what's known through silence. They appear as shadow-imagery, claw-scratch sounds, the things that moved when Fire Keepers looked away. The confession that ended them becomes refrain-worthy: 'Shadow-Broker spoke to sky / Claws went still beneath the stone.'\n**☽'shadow Samsiavae~**: The mine appears through heat-imagery and cleansing-fire metaphors: 'where taint burned black,' 'stone that remembers screaming,' volcanic pulse against tunnel-dark. Its reclamation becomes a scar-image—healed but never smooth. The temperature (15.4) translates to specific warmth: enough to work bareflipper, rare luxury, contested resource.\n**☽'somunis' Mist~Record**: In folk song, the tome becomes sinister riddle: bone-bound pages, words that only appear in absolute dark, readers who vanish or choose silence. Play with the contradiction—it's knowledge preserved but costly to know, wisdom that erases its students. The fire-core binding becomes visceral: volcanic glass that burns to touch, ancestor bone that judges who opens it.\n\n# Cast (4 characters)\n\n## Document Roles\nAssign characters from below to these roles:\n- **song-subject** (1-2): What or whom the song is about - may be a person, place, event, or feeling, transformed into imagery\n- **cultural-origin** (0-1): The community that sings this - their concerns and values shape the song\n\n## Primary Characters\n\n### ☽'somunis' Mist~Record\nKind: artifact/tome\nProminence: 2.9789999999999988\nCulture: nightshelf\nTags: ancient=true, preserved=true, frozen_knowledge=true, fire=true, culture=nightshelf, claimed=true\n\nThe binding is shadow-steel reinforced with femur-carved clasps; the spine bears three deliberate notches—one for each reader who didn't return. Pages of compressed volcanic ash and bioluminescent fungal pulp hold text that glows faintly in darkness but burns away under aurora-light, a contradiction the Nightshelf considers a feature, not a flaw. The tome smells of deep-earth and old fire, and there's a permanent frost-crack running through the back cover where someone—the records don't say who, and the Covens' Order won't clarify—tried to burn it during the Clever Ice Age. It's kept in a shadow-forge vault beneath Scar☽ Lucamlinaecius, wrapped in bioluminescent cloth that's never been changed. The last penguin to request access was a scholar named Tuk'krek. That was seven seasons ago. The cloth is still folded exactly as she left it.\n\n## Supporting Characters\n\n### Drift-coalesce (glacial) (ability/magic)\nProminence: 5, Culture: aurora-stack\nDrift-coalesce begins as a whisper in the blood—aurora-light that won't stay channeled, that crystallizes inward before the practitioner can shape it outward. The ice forms first in the deepest places: capillaries freeze solid; marrow hardens into lattice-work; breath becomes visible and then becomes dangerous, each exhalation leaving frost-flowers that won't melt. Those who've mastered it—and 'mastered' is a generous word for those still living—learn to redirect the coalescence into weapons, into walls, into the bodies of enemies; but the magic leaves its mark on the wielder: fingertips that blacken and crack, eyes that cloud with permanent aurora-shimmer, a cold that spreads from the core outward until even their shadow frosts the ground. Lovumruius~ Domina discovered it wild at The Veil Vents during the Faction Wars, when the Berg's boundaries began to blur and magic spilled up from places that should have stayed sealed. The ability was never meant to be learned; it was meant to be survived. ☽'Netemia Glow-bringer survived it. The ones who came before her did not.\n\n### The Midnight Claws (faction/criminal)\nProminence: 1.4629999999999999, Culture: nightshelf\nOnce the syndicate that moved everything unseen through Nightfall Shelf's depths—fire-cores diverted from Fire Keeper quotas, disappeared bodies fed to the vents, blackmail ledgers that made magistrates sweat—the Midnight Claws now survive on reputation older than their current reach. Nyla inherited the role through methods her subordinates discuss only drunk and never sober: the previous Shadow-Broker was found in the Glow-Fissure with his throat opened to match a claw-mark, though no one saw her do it and everyone knew she did. Her network of informants still exists; the ledgers still exist; the problem is that the Shadow Covens control Nightfall Shelf now, the Wake-Singers own the Veil Vents, and the Claws hold territories that matter less each season—Scar Lucamlinaecius lost to internal bleeding, the Drowned Ledge seized and re-seized until no one remembers who actually owns it. The Accord protections that let them keep their remaining holdings—wake-chanting sanctuaries, deep-route access—depend on proving loyalty to Aurora Stack, a dependency that tightens like a noose.\n\nThey inherited Cell ledgers that referenced ☽'micseleia' Dagger but never explained it, keeping the artifact wrapped in silk in a wall-cache at ☽'slew Ravium~. An orca raid pursuing the dagger tore through the old Cell routes, and the damage caused melt-flow from the deep-forge cores to flood the tunnels—the Claws lost the trade warren that night, along with half their bioluminescent territorial markers. Something changed in how they moved through Nightshelf afterward: more careful, more aware that territory marked was territory that could be taken.\n\nThe bioluminescent claw-marks that once meant 'this is ours and crossing it costs your life' now mean 'we were here; we remember being important.' Members still move through the tunnels with the efficiency of creatures born to darkness, still carry the bone-clasps and fire-core amulets that mark guild affiliation, still share the bitter humor of soldiers fighting a war that ended while they weren't looking—'At least the vents still take bodies,' someone always says, and everyone laughs because the alternative is acknowledging how little they hold. A tunnel-runner named Mortus~ once believed the Claws could be restored through stolen power—he took the Thaw-Paths Medallion thinking it would reveal routes the other factions couldn't access, resources they couldn't touch. He was wrong about the relic, and Nyla framed him with his own ash-prints before confessing to the council herself. The scratches take longer to glow now. No one is certain who leads them, or if leadership still means anything.\n\n### ☽'shadow Samsiavae~ (location/point_of_interest)\nProminence: 4.052999999999999, Culture: nightshelf\nThe entrance tunnel smells of scorched bone and rendered fat—the kind of smell that doesn't leave your nostrils for days. ☽'shadow Samsiavae~ sits three leagues below the Nightshelf's main warren, accessible only through a route the merchants guard like a second spine. The fire-cores here run hotter than anywhere else on The Berg; miners say the volcanic vein remembers something ancient, something that wanted to stay buried. The cavern walls bear Augur ☽'Milucaum~'s cleansing marks—long scorch-trails where corruption was burned clean, leaving the ice beneath brittle and discolored, like old scar tissue. The Midnight Claws carved their insignia into the eastern wall before they lost it; Aureate hasn't bothered removing it, just works around it. The locals call it 'the Scar-mouth' instead of the formal name. They leave small offerings of rendered seal-fat at the deepest brazier—not for the fire, but for the miners who died here when the corruption spread, names no one speaks above ground. The temperature holds steady at 15.4 degrees; warm enough that ice-blisters form on exposed skin within the hour. Work shifts run short. No one stays longer than they have to.\n\n# Narrative Lens\nThis story exists in the shadow of:\n\n## Drift-coalesce (glacial) (ability/magic)\nProminence: 5, Culture: aurora-stack\nTags: mystical=true, wild=true, mundane=true, culture=aurora-stack\n\nDrift-coalesce begins as a whisper in the blood—aurora-light that won't stay channeled, that crystallizes inward before the practitioner can shape it outward. The ice forms first in the deepest places: capillaries freeze solid; marrow hardens into lattice-work; breath becomes visible and then becomes dangerous, each exhalation leaving frost-flowers that won't melt.

The ability was never meant to be learned; it was meant to be survived. ☽'Netemia Glow-bringer survived it. The ones who came before her did not.\n\nLens Guidance: This entity is NOT a character in the story. It is the context — the constraint, the backdrop, the thing everyone knows but no one can change. It should be felt in characters' choices, in what is possible and impossible, in what goes unsaid. Reference it naturally, never explain it to the reader as if they don't know it.\n\n# World: The Berg\nThe Berg is a supernatural iceberg adrift in an endless frozen sea - vast enough to contain mountains, caverns, and civilizations that have never seen its edges. Two penguin colonies survive here: the Aurora Stack, surface dwellers who channel the sky-lights through crystal spires, and the Nightshelf, tunnel dwellers who mine captured fire from volcanic veins deep within the ice. They depend on each other for survival yet differ in everything else - faith, governance, aesthetics, and what they believe the future should hold. Beyond the berg's shores, orca raiders worship a dead god in the deep and conduct increasingly bold raids for resources, slaves, and sacrifices. The aurora pulses with magic. The ice remembers the past. And something vast moves in the darkness below the frozen sea.\n\nCanon Facts:\n(Facts marked with [FACET: ...] include a lens specific to this chronicle. Prioritize the facet - it shows how the universal truth applies to these particular entities and circumstances. The base fact provides context; the facet is your guide.)\n- The Berg's ice remembers. Ancient events leave literal impressions - frozen scenes, echo-sounds, emotional residue. The deeper you go, the older the memories. [FACET: In this chronicle, the ice's memory manifests in two forms: the tome that preserves Faction Wars knowledge in volcanic glass, and the mine's lingering scars from what was burned away. Both demand silence from those who witness them.]\n- Magic on The Berg draws from three sources: aurora-light (ice/crystal/divination), captured fire (forge/transformation/destruction), and pressure-depth (blood/force/communion with the deep). [FACET: The chronicle centers on magic's corruption: aurora-light weaponized underground where it doesn't belong, causing crystallization in living tissue, while fire-magic becomes the tool of reclamation. The two sources clash in bodies and tunnels.]\n- Two penguin civilizations exist: the Aurora Stack (surface dwellers who worship the sky-lights) and the Nightshelf (tunnel dwellers who mine fire from the berg's volcanic core). [FACET: Nightshelf culture dominates, but aurora-magic appears as intrusion and curse—sky-power corrupted by tunnel-darkness, crystallizing in lungs where fire should warm. The surface's gift becomes the deep's weapon.]\n- The folk song embodies Nightshelf values: knowledge as hoarded power, secrets sung but never explained, silence respected. The verses themselves follow Nightshelf speech—elliptical, proverb-laden, coded warnings wrapped in rhythm.\n- No penguin has ever successfully left The Berg and returned. The frozen sea is infinite in all directions. Some say The Berg is the only land that exists. [FACET: The folk song's circular structure mirrors the berg's trap—refrains that return, verses that spiral, no resolution because there's nowhere to go. The Faction Wars are over but their cost keeps echoing in tunnel-songs.]\n- All sapient beings in this world are penguins or orcas. Humans do not exist and have never existed on The Berg.\n\n# Name Bank\nCulture-appropriate names for invented characters:\n- nightshelf: Silvis~, Noctvaesosum~, Esvocivia~ Magister, Noctraetiririus~\n\n# Historical Context\n## Era: The Orca Incursion\nThe orcas come not as raiders but as conquerors, their war-pods striking with coordination that speaks of dark intelligence. Old feuds between Aurora Stack and Abyssal Trench fade as colonies band together against extinction. The innovations of the previous age become weapons; the heroes of this era are defenders who hold the line at impossible odds. Every culture contributes what it knows best: Trench tactical discipline, Stack mystical barriers, and the desperate courage of those with nowhere left to retreat.\n\nThe world passed through the Great Thaw, then the Faction Wars, then the Clever Ice Age. It now exists in the Orca Incursion. the Frozen Peace lies ahead.\n\n# Relationships\n- ☽'somunis' Mist~Record --[stored_at]--> ☽'shadow Samsiavae~\n- The Midnight Claws --[controls]--> ☽'shadow Samsiavae~\n\n# Events\n- [creation_batch, 100%] undefined (subject: ☽'shadow Samsiavae~)\n- [alliance_formed, 55%] undefined (subject: The Midnight Claws)\n- [state_change, 40%] undefined (subject: The Midnight Claws)\n- [state_change, 25%] undefined (subject: The Midnight Claws)",

Two penguin colonies survive here: the Aurora Stack, surface dwellers who channel the sky-lights through crystal spires, and the Nightshelf, tunnel dwellers who mine captured fire from volcanic veins deep within the ice. They depend on each other for survival yet differ in everything else - faith, governance, aesthetics, and what they believe the future should hold. Beyond the berg's shores, orca raiders worship a dead god in the deep and conduct increasingly bold raids for resources, slaves, and sacrifices. The aurora pulses with magic. The ice remembers the past. And something vast moves in the darkness below the frozen sea.\n\nCanon Facts:\n(Facts marked with [FACET: ...] include a lens specific to this chronicle. Prioritize the facet - it shows how the universal truth applies to these particular entities and circumstances. The base fact provides context; the facet is your guide.)\n- The Berg's ice remembers. Ancient events leave literal impressions - frozen scenes, echo-sounds, emotional residue. The deeper you go, the older the memories. [FACET: In this chronicle, the ice's memory manifests in two forms: the tome that preserves Faction Wars knowledge in volcanic glass, and the mine's lingering scars from what was burned away. Both demand silence from those who witness them.]\n- Magic on The Berg draws from three sources: aurora-light (ice/crystal/divination), captured fire (forge/transformation/destruction), and pressure-depth (blood/force/communion with the deep). [FACET: The chronicle centers on magic's corruption: aurora-light weaponized underground where it doesn't belong, causing crystallization in living tissue, while fire-magic becomes the tool of reclamation. The two sources clash in bodies and tunnels.]\n- Two penguin civilizations exist: the Aurora Stack (surface dwellers who worship the sky-lights) and the Nightshelf (tunnel dwellers who mine fire from the berg's volcanic core). [FACET: Nightshelf culture dominates, but aurora-magic appears as intrusion and curse—sky-power corrupted by tunnel-darkness, crystallizing in lungs where fire should warm. The surface's gift becomes the deep's weapon.]\n- The folk song embodies Nightshelf values: knowledge as hoarded power, secrets sung but never explained, silence respected. The verses themselves follow Nightshelf speech—elliptical, proverb-laden, coded warnings wrapped in rhythm.\n- No penguin has ever successfully left The Berg and returned. The frozen sea is infinite in all directions. Some say The Berg is the only land that exists. [FACET: The folk song's circular structure mirrors the berg's trap—refrains that return, verses that spiral, no resolution because there's nowhere to go. The Faction Wars are over but their cost keeps echoing in tunnel-songs.]\n- All sapient beings in this world are penguins or orcas. Humans do not exist and have never existed on The Berg.\n\n# Name Bank\nCulture-appropriate names for invented characters:\n- nightshelf: Silvis~, Noctvaesosum~, Esvocivia~ Magister, Noctraetiririus~\n\n# Historical Context\n## Era: The Orca Incursion\nThe orcas come not as raiders but as conquerors, their war-pods striking with coordination that speaks of dark intelligence. Old feuds between Aurora Stack and Abyssal Trench fade as colonies band together against extinction. The innovations of the previous age become weapons; the heroes of this era are defenders who hold the line at impossible odds. Every culture contributes what it knows best: Trench tactical discipline, Stack mystical barriers, and the desperate courage of those with nowhere left to retreat.\n\nThe world passed through the Great Thaw, then the Faction Wars, then the Clever Ice Age. It now exists in the Orca Incursion. the Frozen Peace lies ahead.\n\n# Relationships\n- ☽'somunis' Mist~Record --[stored_at]--> ☽'shadow Samsiavae~\n- The Midnight Claws --[controls]--> ☽'shadow Samsiavae~\n\n# Events\n- [creation_batch, 100%] undefined (subject: ☽'shadow Samsiavae~)\n- [alliance_formed, 55%] undefined (subject: The Midnight Claws)\n- [state_change, 40%] undefined (subject: The Midnight Claws)\n- [state_change, 25%] undefined (subject: The Midnight Claws)"

Rhythm and rhyme are paramount. Story is optional - if present, it's told obliquely through images and refrains rather than narrated directly. The song should feel like it's been passed through many voices, smoothed by repetition into something that sounds inevitable.\n\nSTRUCTURE:\n- Collector's Note (~40 words): Brief context. Where this song is sung, by whom, on what occasions. Attribution if known (\"commonly heard among the river traders\" or \"attributed to the blind poet Kael\").\n- Verse 1 (~60 words, 4-6 lines): Establish the song's world in images, not exposition. A place, a mood, a season, a figure. The rhythm and rhyme scheme are set here - ABAB, AABB, or ABCB. The reader should hear the melody even without music.\n- Refrain (~30 words, 2-4 lines): The emotional heart. Repeated after each verse. Should be the most singable, most memorable lines. May be a question, a lament, a boast, or a cryptic phrase that gains meaning through repetition.\n- Verse 2 (~60 words, 4-6 lines): Develop or shift. New images that rhyme (thematically, not just phonetically) with verse 1. If there's a story, it advances here - but through image, not plot. The same rhyme scheme.\n- Refrain (repeat)\n- Verse 3 (~60 words, 4-6 lines): The turn or deepening. What seemed simple now carries weight. If a story, its consequence. If mood, its darkest or brightest point. The same structure, different content.\n- Refrain (repeat, possibly with one word changed for devastating effect)\n- Final Verse or Coda (~40 words, 2-4 lines, optional): Brief. May circle back to verse 1's opening image. May break the pattern. Ends the song with resonance.\n\nVOICE & TONE: The voice of many mouths. This song belongs to a community, not an author. The language is simple but precise - no word wasted. Singable, rhythmic, communal, haunting, worn-smooth.\n\nRhyme and rhythm are more important than narrative clarity. Near-rhymes and slant-rhymes are welcome. Meter should be consistent within verses (tetrameter or trimeter work well for folk songs). The song should sound good read aloud.\n\nInclude imagery specific to the world and culture. Use concrete nouns over abstractions. The song's meaning may be debated - \"some say this is about the fall of the Silver Court, others claim it's a love song.\"\n\nAvoid prose disguised as verse, forced rhymes that sacrifice meaning, modern idioms, complex vocabulary. Folk songs use common words arranged uncommonly.\n\n# How to Use Events\nEvents become imagery. A war becomes \"the red year.\" A leader becomes \"the one who wore the crown of thorns.\" The song remembers events as feelings and images, not facts.\n\n# Narrative Voice\nSynthesized prose guidance for this chronicle:\n\n**RHYTHM_AND_COMPRESSION**: Verses flow in strict meter with hard rhymes—this is working song, maintenance chant, something sung to stay awake during fire-core shifts. Semicolons and line breaks do narrative work; enjambment carries momentum between stanzas.\n**IMAGERY_AS_STORY**: Don't narrate—accumulate images. Let frost in lungs, claws scratching stone, pages burning in darkness build meaning through repetition and variation. The refrain returns with new weight each time.\n**NIGHTSHELF_ELLIPSIS**: Speak in the Nightshelf mode: coded warnings, proverbs that sound simple but conceal edges, half-spoken truths. What's left unsaid matters more than what's sung. Names appear without explanation; listeners either know or learn why silence follows.\n**UNDERGROUND_PHYSICALITY**: Every image roots in tunnel-sensory: the smell of fire-core, echo-patterns, weight of stone above. Heat is specific—volcanic, costly, shared. Darkness isn't absence but texture, presence, safety.\n**REFRAIN_AS_WARNING**: The returning chorus isn't comfort—it's reminder, caution, the thing that won't let you forget. Each repetition should accumulate new meaning as verses add context, like a proverb that means more the third time you hear it.\n\n# Entity Writing Directives\nSpecific guidance for writing each entity — interpret creatively, don't reproduce this language directly:\n\n**Drift-coalesce (glacial)**: In verse, this becomes frost-in-wrong-places imagery: ice growing in lungs, marrow crystallizing, breath that cuts from inside. The aurora-stack formality twists into corruption language—'sky-gift turned curse,' 'light that freezes the living.' Show the price physically: frostbite scars, frozen breath, the blue tint under skin that never warms.\n**The Midnight Claws**: Name them in verse but never explain—Nightshelf style respects what's known through silence. They appear as shadow-imagery, claw-scratch sounds, the things that moved when Fire Keepers looked away. The confession that ended them becomes refrain-worthy: 'Shadow-Broker spoke to sky / Claws went still beneath the stone.'\n**☽'shadow Samsiavae~**: The mine appears through heat-imagery and cleansing-fire metaphors: 'where taint burned black,' 'stone that remembers screaming,' volcanic pulse against tunnel-dark. Its reclamation becomes a scar-image—healed but never smooth. The temperature (15.4) translates to specific warmth: enough to work bareflipper, rare luxury, contested resource.\n**☽'somunis' Mist~Record**: In folk song, the tome becomes sinister riddle: bone-bound pages, words that only appear in absolute dark, readers who vanish or choose silence. Play with the contradiction—it's knowledge preserved but costly to know, wisdom that erases its students.

Old feuds between Aurora Stack and Abyssal Trench fade as colonies band together against extinction. The innovations of the previous age become weapons; the heroes of this era are defenders who hold the line at impossible odds. Every culture contributes what it knows best: Trench tactical discipline, Stack mystical barriers, and the desperate courage of those with nowhere left to retreat.\n\nThe world passed through the Great Thaw, then the Faction Wars, then the Clever Ice Age.

      "coreTone": "Dark, war-weary fantasy. History is written by survivors who remember the cost. Tragedy happens without ceremony - important figures die in half-sentences, battles end mid-action.\n\nSTYLE PRINCIPLES:\n- Specificity over abstraction: Not 'a weapon' but 'a fire-core hammer with a cracked head.'\n- Show through action and object, not introspection: Characters reveal themselves by what they do, carry, avoid.\n- Subtext over statement: Let implications land. If someone betrayed their colony, mention they haven't visited the memorial.\n- Uncomfortable details: Include the ugly or unresolved. A hero's hands might be scarred from something shameful.\n- Trust the reader: Don't explain metaphors. End on images, not morals.\n\nSYNTACTIC POETRY:\nCompressed power through rhythm and omission. 'First in; last out; for the last time.' Semicolons do the work of paragraphs. What's unsaid hits harder than what's spoken.\n\nBITTER CAMARADERIE:\nGrimness alone is exhausting. Include dark humor between allies, loyalty despite failure, small kindnesses in terrible contexts. Soldiers who mock the causes they'll die for. Irony that isn't cruel - the bitter laugh, not the sneer.\n\nCLOSING VARIETY:\nNot every ending needs contemplation. Vary: mid-action cut, dark joke, unanswered question, quiet image, bitter irony, someone starting something new.\n\nMULTIPLE ENTITY FOCUSES:\nWhen a chronicle involves multiple entity types, weave rather than list. Find the thread that connects: a character defined by a place, an object that caused an event, a location shaped by who died there. Each element should illuminate another. The transitions matter.\n\nAVOID:\nBalance words (yet, however, ultimately). Introspection clichés ('realized that,' 'in that moment'). Polite diction (gentle, bittersweet, profound). Clean resolutions. Relentless grimness without humor.",

Each stanza circles back to fire and shadow, claws and ice, the price of knowledge written in bone. The Midnight Claws' fall, the mine's reclamation, the tome's silence, the aurora-curse that spreads below—these aren't plot points but recurring images in a refrain. Nightshelf dominates the voice: elliptical, proverb-dense, respecting silence as much as sound. The aurora-stack ability appears as corruption imagery, sky-magic gone wrong in tunnel-dark. This is a song about what the Faction Wars cost, sung by those who survived by keeping secrets. The verses don't explain; they warn. The refrain doesn't resolve; it returns.

  "comparisonReport": "# COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS\n\n## 1. Prose Quality\nVersion 2 has more natural, singable phrasing throughout. Lines like \"Frost that flowers in the marrow, / Breath becomes a frozen song\" and \"Before they lost what Claws could hold\" flow with inevitable-feeling rhythm. Version 1 has strong moments (\"The stone remembers screaming still\"), but stumbles into forced constructions like \"The text burns bright, the text burns cold\" which feels more like poetry exercise than folk memory.\n\n## 2. Structural Choices\nVersion 2's 8-line verses with 4-line refrains follow traditional folk song architecture, giving each verse room to accumulate narrative weight before the warning chorus. Version 1's tighter 6-line/2-line structure feels compressed, almost fragmentary. Version 2's coda delivers a final sting (\"What you know makes you want more\") that reframes the entire song as about dangerous temptation, while Version 1's coda merely restates atmosphere.\n\n## 3. World-Building Detail\nVersion 1 offers the distinctive location name \"☽'shadow Samsiavae~\" and the visceral detail of \"Scar-mouth breathes with rendered fat.\" Version 2 grounds us spatially with \"three leagues below the warren floor\" and \"Volcanic glass and ancient vein,\" plus adds cultural texture with \"The refrain is unlucky to sing above mid-depth\"—the kind of superstition that makes folklore feel lived-in. Version 2's \"Shadow-Broker watched them fall\" introduces another faction organically.\n\n## 4. Narrative Style Adherence (Folk Song)\nVersion 2 better fulfills the folk song mandate. Its refrain is genuinely memorable and singable: \"Ask the tome who never tells / Count the notches—one, two, three\" has the repetitive, incantatory quality of songs passed through many voices. The final refrain's shift from \"or don't come free\" to \"You won't come free\" feels like organic variation singers would introduce. Version 1's collector's note clutters the setup with the folded cloth detail, while Version 2's note is cleaner and includes the folkloric detail about the unlucky refrain.\n\n## 5. Emotional Range\nVersion 2 moves from warning to loss (\"The folded cloth still marks her stand\") to physical horror (\"Frost that flowers in the marrow\") to dangerous temptation in the coda. Version 1 maintains consistent eerie dread but doesn't vary its register much—the emotional temperature stays cold throughout without the tonal shifts that make Version 2 feel like it's been shaped by different singers in different moods.\n\n## 6. Perspective Integration\nVersion 2 better weaves entity directives and faceted facts into the song's fabric. Tuk'krek appears in Verse 2 as part of the narrative flow rather than isolated in the note. The Midnight Claws' decline, Augur's cleansing, and the Shadow-Broker all emerge through imagery rather than exposition. Version 1 front-loads information in the collector's note (\"She hummed this song. The cloth is folded exactly as she left it\"), which feels more described than inhabited.\n\n---\n\n## RECOMMENDATION\n\n**Keep Version 2**. It's structurally stronger, more singable, and better fulfills the folk song format's requirement that rhythm and refrain be paramount while story emerges obliquely. However, Version 1 contains specific world-building gems—particularly the location name \"☽'shadow Samsiavae~\" and the \"rendered fat\" detail—that enrich the setting and shouldn't be lost.\n\n---\n\n## COMBINE INSTRUCTIONS\n\nUse Version 2 as the base for its superior structure, refrain memorability, and folk song rhythm—these are the bones of the piece and should remain intact. From Version 1, draw the distinctive location name \"☽'shadow Samsiavae~\" (integrate it naturally into the collector's note or a verse) and the visceral \"rendered fat\" detail about the Scar-mouth, which adds physical grounding that Version 2's \"Scar-mouth mine\" lacks. Preserve Version 2's tonal progression from warning through loss to dangerous temptation—this emotional arc is what makes it feel like multiple singers have shaped it over time. Don't sacrifice Version 2's singability for additional detail; let any borrowed elements settle into the existing rhythm rather than disrupting it.",
