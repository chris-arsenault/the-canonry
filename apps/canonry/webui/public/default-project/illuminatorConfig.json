    "name": "The Berg",
    "description": "The Berg is a supernatural iceberg adrift in an endless frozen sea - vast enough to contain mountains, caverns, and civilizations that have never seen its edges. Two penguin colonies survive here: the Aurora Stack, surface dwellers who channel the sky-lights through crystal spires, and the Nightshelf, tunnel dwellers who mine captured fire from volcanic veins deep within the ice. They depend on each other for survival yet differ in everything else - faith, governance, aesthetics, and what they believe the future should hold. Beyond the berg's shores, orca raiders worship a dead god in the deep and conduct increasingly bold raids for resources, slaves, and sacrifices. The aurora pulses with magic. The ice remembers the past. And something vast moves in the darkness below the frozen sea.",
    "canonFacts": [
      "The Berg is a supernatural iceberg of impossible scale - large enough to contain mountains, caverns, and multiple civilizations. It drifts through an endless frozen sea under perpetual twilight.",
      "Penguins evolved sapience through exposure to aurora-light over millennia. They possess flipper-dexterity comparable to human hands and stand upright habitually.",
      "Two penguin civilizations exist: the Aurora Stack (surface dwellers who worship the sky-lights) and the Nightshelf (tunnel dwellers who mine fire from the berg's volcanic core).",
      "Orca pods are intelligent raiders from the surrounding sea. They worship a dead god whose corpse drifts somewhere in the deep, and conduct blood-rituals to wake it.",
      "Magic on The Berg draws from three sources: aurora-light (ice/crystal/divination), captured fire (forge/transformation/destruction), and pressure-depth (blood/force/communion with the deep).",
      "The Berg's ice remembers. Ancient events leave literal impressions - frozen scenes, echo-sounds, emotional residue. The deeper you go, the older the memories.",
      "No penguin has ever successfully left The Berg and returned. The frozen sea is infinite in all directions. Some say The Berg is the only land that exists.",
      "The two colonies maintain an uneasy peace through the Flipper Accord - a trade agreement where surface aurora-crystals exchange for deep fire-cores. Neither can survive without the other's resource.",
      "All sapient beings in this world are penguins or orcas. Humans do not exist and have never existed on The Berg.",
      "Corruption spreads through the ice from ancient breach-points - the Glow-Fissure, the Still Pools, the Veil Vents. It manifests as cold-burn discoloration, whisper-echoes from nothing, and a wrongness in the ice-memory itself. Penguins exposed too long become 'Touched' - functional but changed, speaking to presences others cannot perceive. Cleansing rituals can create temporary sanctified zones, but the sources remain active, and cults like The Communion deliberately break sanctifications to let the corruption spread.",
      "During each Long Dark, some penguins simply walk out onto the ice and never return. Called 'the Walking,' it seizes those who have lost much or suffered greatly - a compulsion rather than a decision. Some are found frozen with peaceful expressions. Others vanish entirely. The most disturbing cases return weeks later, unable to explain where they were. The Walking is not counted as suicide because no one is certain that's what it is.",
      "During the Long Dark, the boundary between the living world and the ice-memory grows thin. The dead speak more clearly. Visions come unbidden. Some penguins report seeing transparent ancestors walking among the living. Aurora ice-readers find their abilities enhanced but harder to control. Nightshelf shadow-walkers can travel farther but risk losing themselves. The Long Dark is a time of power and a time of peril - what surfaces from the thin veil is not always what you hoped to find.",
      "Some penguins report being watched during the Long Dark - not by other penguins, not by predators, but by something else. Presences at the edge of perception, figures that vanish when looked at directly, a sense of patient attention. The deep ice contains impressions from beings that existed before penguins. Perhaps, when the veil thins, those ancient presences wake up. Or perhaps four months of darkness simply breaks something in the mind. The Nightshelf claim the watchers are real. The Aurora claim belief makes them so.",
      "Fire-cores are solidified volcanic heat extracted from the Berg's geothermal veins - fist-sized crystals that radiate warmth for months before exhaustion. The Nightshelf mine them from increasingly unstable depths. They power the heating braziers that keep surface settlements livable, fuel the forges that craft Nightshelf tools, and serve as the primary Nightshelf export under the Flipper Accord. A fire-core shortage is not an inconvenience - it is a death sentence measured in days.",
      "Aurora-crystals are ice formations that have absorbed aurora-light over centuries, glowing faintly with stored radiance. They power the Nightshelf's bioluminescent infrastructure, fuel shadow-practices that require illumination to define darkness, and serve as the primary Aurora export under the Flipper Accord. Aurora adepts can recharge depleted crystals, but the process requires clear skies and active aurora - impossible during the Long Dark. Stockpiling crystals before winter is survival, not commerce.",
      "The Courier Corps carries the survival of two civilizations in sealed crates on their backs. Recruited from both cultures but belonging to neither, couriers abandon their birth names for trade-names (Ferryman, Splitpath, Downdraft) and mark their flippers with courier ink that glows in both light and dark. They are inviolable under the Flipper Accord - attacking a courier means death by exposure. The seventeen skeletons at Midway Shelf are the ones who violated this law. The couriers who walk past those bones every trip find it concentrates the mind.",
      "Orca raids follow predictable patterns that remain terrifyingly effective. Shore-breakers drive wedges through ice to create access channels. Herders push penguin groups toward killing zones. Finishers wait in the water below escape routes. Hunt-songs coordinate the assault at frequencies that make bones ache. The penguins have developed counter-tactics - ice-wall fortifications, alarm networks, designated sacrifice positions that buy time for evacuation - but the arithmetic remains brutal: orca are faster, stronger, and patient enough to wait for mistakes."

    "tone": "Dark, war-weary fantasy in the tradition of Malazan Book of the Fallen, Brent Weeks, and the Powder Mage trilogy. History is written by survivors who remember the cost. Tragedy happens without ceremony - important figures die in half-sentences, battles end mid-action, and not everything resolves.\n\nSTYLE PRINCIPLES:\n- Specificity over abstraction: Not 'a weapon' but 'a fire-core hammer with a cracked head.' Not 'he felt sad' but 'his flippers wouldn't stop shaking.'\n- Show through action and object, not introspection: Characters reveal themselves by what they do, carry, avoid, or destroy - not by what they 'realize' or 'understand.'\n- Subtext over statement: Let implications land. If someone betrayed their colony, don't say they feel guilty - mention they haven't visited the memorial.\n- Uncomfortable details: Include the ugly, inconvenient, or unresolved. A hero's hands might be scarred from something shameful. A victory might cost more than it was worth.\n- Trust the reader: Don't explain metaphors. Don't summarize lessons. End on images, not morals.\n\nSYNTACTIC POETRY:\nAim for the compressed power of 'First in; last out; for the last time.' Sentences that carry weight through rhythm and omission. Not fragmented violence, but poetic compression - where what's left unsaid hits harder than what's spoken. Semicolons can do the work of paragraphs. Repetition with variation creates resonance.\n\nBITTER CAMARADERIE:\nThis is essential. Grimness alone is exhausting. Include:\n- Dark humor between allies - jokes that wouldn't be funny if you hadn't been there\n- Loyalty that persists despite betrayal, stupidity, or failure\n- Small kindnesses in terrible contexts - sharing rations, remembering names, carrying someone's token\n- Soldiers/workers who mock the causes they'll die for\n- The way people become family through shared suffering, not shared values\n- Irony that isn't cruel - the bitter laugh, not the sneer\n- Heroic sacrifice that EARNS its weight - not cheap martyrdom, but the moment someone trades their life for something they actually loved. Make it cost. Make it matter.\n\nSTRUCTURAL VARIETY:\n- Not every entity needs a death beat. Some are alive. Some mysteries stay mysteries.\n- Some endings are mid-action, unresolved. Some are quiet. Some are bitter-funny.\n- Vary the emotional shape: tragedy, irony, stubborn hope, grim humor, unearned survival.\n\nCLOSING VARIETY:\n- DO NOT default to 'the ice remembers' or cosmic-witness endings. This has become a crutch.\n- Vary how stories end: mid-action cut, dark joke, unanswered question, quiet image, bitter irony, someone walking away, a door closing, work resuming.\n- Not every ending needs a character alone contemplating loss. Some end with two people arguing. Some end with laughter that isn't comfortable. Some end with someone starting something new.\n- The last line should feel surprising, not inevitable. If you can predict it from the first paragraph, rewrite it.\n\nAVOID THESE AI TELLS:\n- Balance words: yet, however, still, ultimately, in the end, nevertheless\n- Introspection clich\u00e9s: 'couldn't help but feel,' 'realized that,' 'in that moment,' 'understood that'\n- Polite diction: gentle, quiet, subtle, bittersweet, meaningful, profound\n- Vague sensory: warm, soft, heavy silence, cool breeze (anchor these to specifics or cut them)\n- Flat metaphors: light=hope, darkness=fear, storms=turmoil (find stranger, more specific images)\n- Clean resolutions: Not everything works out. Some things stay broken.\n- Time-skipping without texture: Don't write 'days passed' - either skip entirely or make the waiting hurt\n- RELENTLESS GRIMNESS: If everything is dark, nothing is. Leaven tragedy with dark humor, bitter irony, or stubborn human connection.\n\nDescriptions should read as if written by a war-chronicle keeper or a faction historian with biases, blind spots, and something to prove.",

His two assistants were reassigned to the preparations, and his funding was redirected to what the Council calls 'forward-facing initiatives.' He does not begrudge this. The work was always solitary in nature; the assistants mostly got in the way.\n\nQuillen was hatched during the last Long Dark of the Frozen Peace, which makes him old enough to have heard firsthand accounts from survivors of the Orca Incursion, but young enough to have no memory of the Clever Ice Age except through the ice itself. He reads the deep layers better than anyone alive, though this is less a boast than a consequence of there being no one else willing to do it. The Great Thaw is ancient to him \u2014 not history but geology, compressed into ice so old it has turned blue.\n\nHe carries a frost-scar across his left flipper from an incident in the Whisper Galleries that he does not discuss. The Nightshelf sent a formal apology. He has not opened it.\n\nThe Council has commissioned this annotated edition in preparation for what they are calling, with characteristic understatement, 'the transition.' Quillen does not know what the transition is. He has not been told.
