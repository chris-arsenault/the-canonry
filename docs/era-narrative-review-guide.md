# Era Narrative Review Guide

## Noun Saturation

- [ ] No paragraph lists more than three named factions or institutions
- [ ] Every proper noun performs an action or connects to a later sentence
- [ ] Governance fractures described through forces and consequences, not org charts

## World as Actor

- [ ] The Berg, corruption, ice, artifacts have concrete verbs — not just backdrop
- [ ] Governance vacuums filled by non-institutional agents acting, not by listing who vacated
- [ ] Landscape and forces are grammatical subjects where institutions used to be catalogued

## Dynamics Injection

- [ ] No verbatim tunnel-handoff ledgers or desecration site lists appearing across eras
- [ ] World dynamics material is era-specific, not boilerplate repeated everywhere
- [ ] If a dynamic appears, it's woven into the narrative — not dropped in as a catalogue

## Arc Direction Compliance

- [ ] The thesis reflects the arc direction's framing, not generic era summary
- [ ] The burden of proof sits where the arc direction placed it
- [ ] Thread synthesis responds to the arc direction's constraints

## Thread Convergence

- [ ] Threads serve a unifying argument, not parallel independent essays
- [ ] Each culture's arc intersects with the others at specific points
- [ ] Strategic dynamics (the arrows between cultures) are visible in the draft, not just in the synthesis
