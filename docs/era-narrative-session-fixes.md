# Era Narrative — Session Fix Review

## Dynamics Filtering

Were era-irrelevant world dynamics injected into the narrative? Look for:
- Tunnel-handoff ledgers (☽'slew Ravium~, Scar☽ Lucamlinaecius, Whispered Shrift~) appearing in eras they don't belong to
- Desecration site catalogues repeated verbatim across eras
- Any passage that reads like injected reference material rather than narrative prose

## Institutional Inventory

Does movement 2 (governance/political fracture) collapse into a catalogue of faction names? Look for:
- More than three named factions in a single paragraph
- Proper nouns that appear once, perform no action, and never recur
- Power transfers listed as sequence rather than dramatized as consequence

## World as Actor

When governance fractures, does the world fill the vacuum? Look for:
- The Berg, ice, corruption, artifacts acting with concrete verbs
- Landscape and non-institutional forces as grammatical subjects
- Red flag: a governance vacuum described only by listing which factions contest it

## Thread Convergence

Do threads serve one argument or run as parallel essays? Look for:
- Each culture's arc passing through the era's central dynamic (not running beside it)
- Strategic dynamics visible in the draft — moves and counter-moves between cultures
- Red flag: a thread that could be removed without affecting any other thread
