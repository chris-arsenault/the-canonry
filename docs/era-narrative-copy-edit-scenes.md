# Era Narrative — Copy Edit Scene Additions

Scenes to add via free-text field during copy editing. Each is prose extracted
from a prior version that the best editing base lost when fixing structural
problems (dynamics injection, institutional inventory, thread convergence).

---

## The Clever Ice Age (base: v5 / 1771753014964)

**No scene addition needed.** v5 is clean on all four session-fix axes and has
no critical scene losses from v4. The Communion/Medallion section is dense and
could be tightened by the editor, but nothing was lost that needs restoring.

## The Orca Incursion (base: v3 / 1771754053310)

**Add: convergence-crystallization paragraph and knowledge-doctrine passage.**

v3 eliminated v2's desecration-site catalogue and tunnel-handoff names, and
strengthened orca interiority and world-as-actor. But it lost the single
paragraph where the thesis crystallizes as a moment of discovery, and the
knowledge-doctrine passage that was the best geopolitical integration in any
era narrative. The editor should place the convergence passage in or near the
Flipper Accord thread's material (after the Cracked Blade Pact or the
disclosure scene), and weave the doctrine passage into the section on
Nightshelf knowledge-sharing under wartime pressure.

### Convergence crystallization

> The deeper convergence happened outside any signed agreement. Aurora mystics
> trained in aurora-communion discovered that the same resonance connecting
> them to the sky's light could be directed as force — that the Ring's
> harmonic was a weapon if the bearer stopped pretending it was a tool.
> Nightshelf shadow-operatives discovered that sealed tunnels and hoarded
> cartographic knowledge constituted kill-architecture against an aquatic
> predator that could not compensate for structural confinement. The Stack's
> verticality and the Nightshelf's horizontality, developed across generations
> of deliberate opposition, turned out to be the complementary halves of a
> defense that neither could have mounted alone.
>
> But each capability could only deploy at scale by violating the principles
> that had produced it. The Ring was sacred patrimony; its bearer cracked
> under the resonance. The tunnels were sealed for secrecy; they were opened
> for joint defense. Shadow-craft was knowledge hoarded as power; it was
> shared because hoarded knowledge was getting people killed. Fire-core
> logistics operated through transactional secrecy; they became the supply
> chain for a war effort that could not function on secrecy's terms.

### Knowledge-doctrine passage

> Three competing doctrines about how knowledge should move —
> Mandatum∴absconditu demanding secrecy for survival, Way∴ens demanding open
> flow, Pactum∴myster binding initiates to blood-oath silence — were not
> philosophical positions. They were operational constraints that determined
> who lived. The Pactum∴silenti's neurological binding prevented operatives
> from warning about corruption fissures during joint supply missions.
> Fire-craft knowledge was simultaneously classified as contraband by the
> Mbra∴silentiu dispatch and required for maintaining defensive braziers in
> jointly held territory. *The weight moves. The warmth follows. Compliance
> ensures both.* The formula that encoded the Nightshelf's strategic leverage
> over the Stack in eleven words remained operational through every phase of
> the Incursion. The warmth followed the weight. If the weight stopped moving
> through approved channels, so did survival.

## The Frozen Peace (base: v2 / 1771755261912)

**Add: the Cilocum/Otrolal correspondence.**

v2 fixed v1's dynamics injection (tunnel-handoff ledger, desecration
catalogue) and institutional inventory (faction-sequence paragraph), and
delivered the mythologization the arc direction required. But it lost the
era's most emotionally precise scene — the nine-month correspondence that
produced the aphorism "tending a fire that's already gone out." The editor
should place this in the knowledge-wars section or the Accord-dependency
section, where it dramatizes the fire-core reclassification that the v2
narrative discusses in more compressed form.

### Cilocum/Otrolal correspondence

> In the year 190, a Nightshelf intelligence officer named Cilocum and a
> logistics coordinator named Otrolal exchanged nine months of correspondence
> across the Accord boundary — letters that tracked, in the space between
> formal language and shared grammar, the precise mechanism by which
> necessities were being reclassified as luxuries by administrators who would
> never feel the cold. A twelve-crate shortfall. Not the number itself but
> the layered reading both correspondents performed: Cilocum hearing what the
> Stack delegation did not say, Otrolal translating the silence — *someone
> decided our warming-months are negotiable.* Two trained intelligences
> arriving at the same conclusion through different channels, one acoustic,
> one logistical. This is how institutions die — not through betrayal but
> through the quiet reclassification of what is essential by those positioned
> above its absence.
>
> Otrolal's final letter arrived on clean pressed lichen with trimmed edges.
> The ancestor-bone clasp was absent from the seal. The fire had been tended.
> The content described the Cell's operations at the sixth vein as "tending a
> fire that's already gone out." The care of the document contradicting its
> message. Whatever Otrolal was becoming no longer belonged to a lineage. The
> phrase migrated into Nightshelf colloquial speech and remained there,
> applied in time to the Accord itself by those accurate enough to be
> tolerated.

## The Faction Wars (base: v1 / 1771749143731)

**No scene addition needed.** v1 is the strongest single draft in the
sequence. The orca thread is thinner than the other four (2 source chronicles
vs 4-5), but the prose is strong and the section earns its weight — "They
went down" is a perfect closing beat. The counterweight (Kael, Mairae~/Hollows,
Silvsiaelrous, Zheishongfeihua) is the deepest of any era narrative and is
already present. No prior version exists to pull from.
